# Reproducible Research with R

## Preparation for the course

Each participants should prior to the course:

* Complete [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/) courses 
  + Beginner: Introduction to R and Imprting in data in R
  + Beginner & Intermediate: Intermediate R and Introduction tidyverse. 
  + Beginner & Intermediate & Advanced: Intermediate Data Visualization with ggplot2 and Reshaping Data with tidyr
  If you have not yet received an invitation to datacamp please contact us!
* Install in the newest(!) version:  
  + [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
  + [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)  
  + [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (this is for version control)
* Get an account for:
  + [Github](https://github.com/) You can have the academic version with Charité email
*Set up Rstudio with ssh key to connect to github
Please set up RStudio on your computer to connect to github.
We will have some time in the beginner session to test whether this works.

Important resources to use if you do not know how to proceed/need help:

* [Cheat sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) on different packages like tidyverse, ggplot, etc. 
* Stackoverflow: A community of nerds at your disposal. All beginners questions have been already posted so a simple search is enough!
* help function in R (put cursor on function name and press F1 or type ?function_name)
* at the end of each help text there is a so called vignette that will give an executable example so that you can experiment with the function and its outputs
* Please refrain from using AI for now. We will discuss the efficient use of AI in the last session.
