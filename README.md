# Reproducible Research with R

## Preparation for the course

Each participants should prior to the course:

* Complete [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/) courses 
  + Beginner: Introduction to R and Imprting in data in R
  + Beginner & Intermediate: Intermediate R and Introduction tidyverse. 
  + Beginner & Intermediate & Advanced: Intermediate Data Visualization with ggplot2 and Reshaping Data with tidyr
  If you have not yet received an invitation to datacamp please contact us!
* Install in the newest(!) version:  
  + [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
  + [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)  
  + [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (this is for version control)
* Get an account for:
  + [Github](https://github.com/) You can have the academic version with Charité email

Important resources to use if you do not know how to proceed/need help:

* [Cheat sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) on different packages like tidyverse, ggplot, etc. 
* Stackoverflow: A community of nerds at your disposal. All beginners questions have been already posted so a simple search is enough!
* help function in R (put cursor on function name and press F1 or type ?function_name)
* at the end of each help text there is a so called vignette that will give an executable example so that you can experiment with the function and its outputs
* Please refrain from using AI for now. We will discuss the efficient use of AI in the last session.
